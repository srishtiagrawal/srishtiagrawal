👋 Hi, I’m Srishti Agrawal.

I am a software developer with 5 years of experience who's more focused on front-end development. I’m always looking forward to utilize my skills to solve problems in different industries and make this world a happy place. 

🌱 **About me:** 

I am a UI enthusiast who solves business problems and create user-friendly websites using JavaScript ReactJs, Angular 2+, NodeJs, bootstrap etc. I have had the exposure to work on the Dot Net technologies in the past and I've created various modules using C#, REST APIs, OOPS, SQL etc. I have the ability to create mockup designs for the website as well as convert them into working modules.  

Other than coding, I love creating arts where I can unleash my imaginations. I like to cook Indian cuisines. For my mental and physical well-being, I stay connected with Nature's ☘🌍 idyllic beauty and do Yoga & meditation 🧘‍♀. Currently I am enjoying learning flute..🎵
